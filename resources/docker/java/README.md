## DynamoDBLocal.jar

This **local-only** testing JAR file is here to satisfy `ctest` (see [Running the server tests](https://github.com/slateci/slate-client-server/blob/develop/resources/docs/server_testing.md)).

At some point the need for this file should be removed in favor of the DynamoDB instance provided by `docker-compose up`.
